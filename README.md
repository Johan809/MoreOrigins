### Note: 
I personally recommend using a mod that shows the recipes, like [REI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-items) in Fabric.
Oceanite (the base item for Oceanite armor) it's made out of Prismarine Shards (A), Primarine Crystals (B) and Diamonds (C), with the pattern:
BAB
ACA
BAB
