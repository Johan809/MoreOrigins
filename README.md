> ### Piglin Lord
>
> Natives of the Nether, Ancient piglins whose power surpasses their predecessors.
>
> 游릭 **All That Glitters:** Golden tools deal extra damage and golden armor has additional protection. Golden equipment lasts much longer, but non golden and non netherite equipment breaks faster. Netherite armor gives a small speed boost.
> 
> 游릭 **Golden Sacrifice:** (Primary Active) Consuming a block of gold on your offhand grants you Strength II, Resistance II, and Regeneration II for 30s, 1m cooldown.
>
> 游릭 **Netherite Dexterity:** As warrior lords, ancient piglins have mastered combat in armor, and wearing the best of these gives them speed as they move. 
> 
> 游릭 **Piglin Neutrality:** Piglins do not attack you unless provoked. Brutes will still attack on sight.
> 
> 游릭 **Crossbow Master:** You deal 75% more damage with crossbows.
> 
> 游릭 **Fiery Skin:** You are completely immune to fire and lava, and don't even begin to burn; but only in the Nether.
> 
> 游릭 **Good Health:** (hidden) You have 3 more hearts.
> 
> 游리 **Carnivore:** Your diet is based solely on meat, although with some golden exceptions...
>
> 游댮 **Nether Inhabitant:** Your natural spawn will be in the Nether.
> 
> 游댮 **Soul Spooked:** You are afraid of Soul Fire, becoming weak when near it.
> 
> 游댮 **Homesick:** When outside of the Nether, you zombify, becoming undead and slower.
> 
> 游댮 **Photoallergic:** You begin to burn in daylight.
>
